Track: Women's Safety
"Empower your safety like never before!"
This initiative establishes a secure environment for women by utilizing Aadhar card registration. It enables women to create multiple channels, add chosen contacts, and stores user addresses to notify nearby contacts and family in emergencies. It hosts a community for women to share past incidents and locations, aiding the creation of a safety level database. The system identifies red alert zones and locations through machine learning. Additionally, it offers transport recommendations for various areas and advocates for government safety measures.
